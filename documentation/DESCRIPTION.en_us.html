    Justfont Huninn is an open-source Traditional Chinese round typeface specially designed for use in Taiwan. 
    The font includes commonly used characters in Taiwan, Zhuyin (Bopomofo) symbols, and even adds Taigi and Hokkien phonetic symbols and characters to meet local requirements.
    Besides creating characters, the designers also refined the typographic settings and improved the grayscale quality of the original sources.
