Justfont Huninn is an open-source Traditional Chinese round typeface based on the [Kosugi Maru](https://github.com/googlefonts/kosugi-maru) and [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round) fonts, specially designed for better use in Taiwan.

The font includes commonly used characters in Taiwan, Zhuyin (Bopomofo) symbols, and even adds Taigi and Hokkien phonetic symbols and characters to meet local requirements. 

Besides creating more than 2,000 new characters, the designers also refined the typographic settings and improved the grayscale quality of the original sources.
